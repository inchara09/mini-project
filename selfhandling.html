<h1><strong>A Letter to Parents Surviving a Child’s Suicide</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>There Is No Timeline</strong></h2>
<p>The first bit of insight I wish to share is that there is no timeline for this journey that you’re on. If you’re a planner, throw that attitude out the window. If you’re looking for an agenda of what to expect, when, and how to do it, you’ll be disappointed.</p>
<p>Understand that you’ve been put on a journey that has no end but it <strong><em>will</em></strong> continue to move forward. Each day will bring new challenges, new surprises, and new moments of clarity and even joy. Yes, even joy.</p>
<h2><strong> There Is No Right Answer </strong></h2>
<p>“Why did this happen?”</p>
<p>If you have not asked this question yet, you will.</p>
<p>If you knew your child was suffering you’ll want to know why you couldn’t stop him from taking his life. If you didn’t know, you’ll want to know why she did it or why you didn’t recognize it.&nbsp; There are probably many other questions you’re seeking answers to.</p>
<p>Simply put, there’s no right answer.</p>
<h2><strong> I Give You Permission</strong></h2>
<p>I give you permission to smile or laugh if you find something that encourages you to do so. I also give you permission to cry and shout if that’s what you’re feeling at that moment.</p>
<p>For quite some time I was conflicted by the mixed emotions I was experiencing. The day after I learned about my son’s death someone recounted a story that was quite funny and I laughed out loud among a room full of people somberly mourning my son’s passing. I immediately felt embarrassed for the outburst; how dare I laugh at such a time.</p>
<p>In the weeks and months after his death, I would talk about or share a picture of me going about my life, be it enjoying a soccer game or taking a needed vacation from life. In a few instances I felt guilty for allowing the public to see that I went on living or guilty that I was living.&nbsp; That guilt was compounded by others criticizing me for doing so – or for doing so publicly.</p>
<p>What took me a long time to realize – and what I want you to know – is that while I felt that I needed permission from others to laugh, cry, or live my life, I really didn’t. If you’re feeling that way, I’m giving you permission. As a survivor, I give you permission to smile, laugh, and live – if you feel like it.</p>
<h2><strong> Walk Your Path, Accept Your Spouse’s Path </strong></h2>
<p>There a number of studies that point to the fact that a majority of couples who experience the loss of a child end up in divorce court.&nbsp; Some point to the feelings of guilt or isolation, the inability to resolve the loss of their child with the perceived “natural order of things” or, most often, the inability to manage the complicated trauma and grieving process each parent experiences.</p>
<p>The key is to quickly understand that each parent will experience the grief differently and his or her reactions will be unique to them. If you look at your spouse and think “how can he do that?” or “why isn’t she doing this?” understand that they’re thinking the same about you.</p>
<p>Give yourself permission to deal with your grief and mourning in your way and give him or her latitude to follow their journey without judgement or timeline.</p>
<h2><strong> Be Kind to Yourself</strong></h2>
<p>I felt like I needed to be there for my wife, my daughter, my parents, my son’s friends, and everyone else. I needed to “be normal” for my daughter and keep working for the sake of my business and employees. I had to be strong.</p>
<p>What I discovered quickly is that I could be of no use to anyone without first allowing myself to be kind to me. I needed to allow myself some personal time to simply enjoy something – anything – that would give my brain and heart a break from the pain.</p>
<h2><strong> Find a Support Group</strong></h2>
<p>My wife and I have experienced our grief differently, yet there is one thing we will agree to: Joining a support group of peers who have experienced the loss of a family member to suicide was one of the best things we could have done.</p>
<p>The loss of a child to suicide is so unique that even you’ll find it difficult to relate to those who have lost their children to physical illness or accidents. In fact, many like us don’t want to speak to others for fear of judgement. I get it.</p>
<p>Bereaved parents support groups are useful but where possible, find a support group of suicide survivors.</p>
<h2><strong>Being &#8220;OK&#8221; is Exhausting</strong></h2>
<p>Allow yourself the time to rest, you&#8217;ll need it just from being.</p>
<h2><strong>Celebrate the Life of Your Child on Special Occasions</strong></h2>
<p>That small change in attitude – with a little planning – has made these celebrations more meaningful and helped us to move along that journey instead of getting stuck on it.</p>
<h2><strong> Your Child Did Not Do This to You</strong></h2>
<p>Among the unending variety of emotions you’ll experience, anger and/or guilt will be two of the strongest.</p>
<p>“Why did he do this to me?”</p>
<p>“What did I do wrong?”</p>
<p>“I should have prevented this.”</p>
<p>What I’ve discovered from speaking to many teens and young adults who are suffering with depression is that at their lowest moments, they are not thinking of you – or anyone for that matter. They simply can’t think or experience any reality beyond the pain and anxiety they are feeling at that moment.</p>
<p>As survivors, we must find a way to accept that this was not a rational choice. The illness of depression took that choice away from them.</p>
<p>They did not die from suicide…they died from depression. The choice was not theirs.</p>
<h2><strong> Lean In</strong></h2>
<p>One phrase that was shared with me while chatting with my suicide survivor’s support group was “lean into the pain.”&nbsp; It is meant to encourage you to not avoid the emotions you are experiencing, no matter how difficult they may be.&nbsp; Grief – and all the emotions that it pulls – is just an obstacle on the journey. Avoiding it will prevent you from getting to where you need to be.</p>
<p>Each will happen and each should be welcomed as a necessary part of the journey.</p>
<h2><strong> It Won’t Be OK but It Will Be Fine</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>The Journey</strong></h2>
<p>You may have noticed my constant reference to a journey in this letter. That wasn’t by design. It’s a fact that you’ll come to realize if you have not done so already. Whatever you’re experiencing, you are on a journey and one that is truly unique to you.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace the journey; like life itself, it will be riddled with highs and lows and each must be experienced to become the person you are.</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, you don’t need to walk this journey alone. There are support groups, professionals, and individuals who can help. My experience has been that my peers – those who have also lost a loved one to suicide – are the best support.</p>
