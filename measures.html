   <h3><strong>What to do if you’re experiencing active suicidal thoughts</strong></h3>
   <p>If you’re considering methods of suicide or actively thinking about ending your life, these steps can help you stay safe while you work on getting more longer-term support:</p>
   <ul>
   <li><h3><strong>Reach out.</strong></h3>
   <p>Trusted loved ones can listen and offer emotional support. They can also help you stay safe. If you’re not sure who to turn to, start with a crisis counselor: They’ll listen with compassion and offer guidance on ways to reach out.</p>
   </li>
   <li><h3><strong>Go somewhere safe.</strong></h3>
   <p>Getting to a safe location can make it easier to avoid acting on suicidal thoughts. You might try a library or other public space, a friend’s house, or somewhere else you feel comfortable, like even a different room in your house.</p>
   </li>
   <li><h3><strong>Lock up or get rid of weapons.</strong></h3>
   <p>Safety also means staying away from weapons, medications, or other possible methods of suicide. A friend or family member can help you remove these items or stay with you, especially if you need to continue taking medication. They can offer one dose at a time so you don’t have access to excess pills.</p>
   </li>
   <li><h3><strong>Avoid alcohol and other substances.</strong></h3>
   <p>Drinking alcohol or using substances might seem helpful for numbing painful and unwanted emotions, but you might find they actually worsen depression and suicidal thoughts.</p>
   </li>
   <li><h3><strong>Try grounding techniques.</strong></h3>
   <p>Going for a short walk, cuddling a pet, and 4-7-8 breathing are all examples of grounding techniques that can help you stay in the present during a moment of intense distress. Not sure how to get started? A crisis counselor can also talk (or text) you through trying them out.</p>
   </li>
   <li><h3><strong>Do something that helps you relax.</strong></h3>
   <p>Listening to music, savoring a favorite food or beverage, or looking at photos (or videos) of people and animals you love can help you feel calmer and less distressed.</p>
   </li>
   <li><h3><strong>Get professional support.</strong></h3>
   <p>Working with a trained mental health professional is generally the best way to manage thoughts of suicide. A therapist can offer guidance with identifying possible triggers and exploring treatment options, plus help you create a safety plan.</p>
   </li>
   </ul>
